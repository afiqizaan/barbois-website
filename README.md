# BarBois Website

**BarBois** is a project developed to promote and encourage fitness through 
calisthenics. This website was created as part of a group project using HTML 
and CSS to represent the BarBois organization, which is dedicated to maintaining
individual health and well-being through calisthenics exercises.

## About BarBois

**BarBois** is a fictional organization that focuses on:
- Improving health and fitness through calisthenics, a type of exercise that uses only body weight.
- Promoting exercises that can be performed anywhere, utilizing the environment around us, such as parks, beaches, or home settings.
- Providing information on performing basic compound exercises (e.g., push-ups, pull-ups, dips, and squats).

Calisthenics offers a budget-friendly and accessible fitness solution,
unlike heavy weight-based exercises, and requires minimal equipment.
**BarBois** aims to empower individuals with the knowledge and resources to achieve their fitness goals anytime and anywhere.
